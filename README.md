# REAL-ESTATE-PRICE-PREDICTION-RECOMMENDATION-SYSTEM
Designed and implemented an end-to-end ML pipeline for residential property price prediction using structured real estate datasets.
Performed robust data preprocessing including outlier detection, missing value imputation, categorical encoding, and domain-driven feature engineering.
Conducted statistical EDA and correlation analysis to identify key pricing drivers across micro-locations, amenities, and property configurations.
Trained and benchmarked multiple regression and ensemble models (Linear, Regularized, Tree-based, Boosting) using cross-validation to optimize predictive performance.
Developed a content-based recommendation engine and analytics dashboard, and deployed the full-stack solution via Streamlit for real-time inference.
